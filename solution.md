# Vue Exercise Project

This is the exercise project on Vue js

## Architecture & Solution
 The architecture is depends on the following:
 Views : It contains all the pages
 Store : Vuex store, to have same data across the application
 Router : For navigation between pages/components
 
 The solution is quite simple, user enters the welcome page and starts the wizard.
On Form page it enters all the info, we compute that info to show the insurance amount and store it to our global store and either route it to summary page or error page based on the condition. On summary page all the info is displayed that is stored for that user.
